# HDS-SummerCamp21

## Introduction and Instructions:
In the next 15 days, we will try to cover the basics of CAD Designing using Solidworks and
Basic types of Studies (Stress-Strain, Topology and Motion) also using Solidworks. From our
experience so far, the best approach would be going through the tutorials first and right
away applying it to build a part whose drawing will be provided to you. Theoretical parts
would be kept at a minimum. TBH, what you learnt (or slept through, Lucky Chaps!) in ED is
all the pre-requisites you will need.

Let’s get the basic points regarding submission out of the way.
1. Download SW 2018 only. It won’t be possible for us to check newer versions as we ourselves have SW 2018. [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JThAB3j7ZOxwS6bdzFkAJfCLz3WnLmDo/view)
  - It is 13GB. You might need to upgrade your internet plan for a day to download it.
  - If you have internet issues, try downloading [Fusion 360. 2-3GB](https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overviewsorting=featured&page=1&filters=individual)
    - Use your IIT BHU ID and download the educational version.
    - If you’re too rich, Fusion 360 is the only option for you. (Mac Users)
  - Though the instructions will be in SW, you can use any program you like. Only difference will be in the menus and interface. We can only clear doubts of
Fusion 360, SW and CATIA. (Not AutoCAD)
  - Try to download SW, it will be easier to follow along the tutorials.
2. Watch the [installation video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1izRq2z-kI5NHDZxYg9SqlzzrwGMQDT0U/view) Very Carefully. Download SW 2018 using above link.
3. It is recommended to have i5/8 GB/ GPU.
4. Minimum – i3/4GB/No GPU. You will face lags though.
5. Mouse is mandatory.

The tutorials are based on SolidWorks Basics extended Instrucrions by Prof C. Sikora on
Vertanux1.com. We have trimmed them to include the basics. If you want, you can check
out the full version on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLROUP1bV8REQmZgDTTJ0JCanXS8uySo-4) and the advanced instruction on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLROUP1bV8REQ3uB7OTT3GunhdOOOfvLFz). Let’s get started ..
