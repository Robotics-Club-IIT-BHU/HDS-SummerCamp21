# Create a URDF of any robot(biped, quadruped, wheeled, stationary arm, Rajnikanth, Big hero 6 etc.) of your choice. Use whatever methods/softwares you want.

## The only requirement: The robot should be designed by you, not copy-pasted and should have a reasonable level of realism (i.e. Don't join 2 cylinders to a cuboid and call it a biped, Don't build something as simple as husky etc.)
