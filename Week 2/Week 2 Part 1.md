# Part 1 3D sketching

While 2D sketching can ably define extrusions, holes, paths and other features, its uniplanar restriction is cumbersome, if not unworkable, when drawing some complex shapes.
SOLIDWORKS includes a 3D sketch tool to make the process of creating geometry that snakes or slides through 3D dimensions.


Just like its 2D counterpart, the 3D sketch tool creates geometry by using points, lines, splines and any other sketchable shape to define a profile. 
What’s different about 3D sketching is that instead of drawing on a single plane, 3D sketching can exist on multiple planes simultaneously.

## Wire Routing: Primary use of 3D sketch

Looking to find the most efficient route to connect two electrical systems within a product? With 3D sketching users can build that wire, 
connect the systems and measure the length of product they’ll need to wire up their device.

## Used for complex geometries as well

Lofting is a drafting technique whereby curved lines are generated, to be used in plans for **streamlined objects** such as aircraft and boats. The lines may be drawn on wood and the wood then cut for advanced woodworking.
As ship design evolved from craft to science, designers learned various ways to produce long curves on a flat surface. Generating and drawing such curves became a part of ship lofting; "lofting" means drawing full-sized patterns, so-called because it was often done in large, lightly constructed mezzanines or lofts above the factory floor. When aircraft design progressed beyond the stick-and-fabric boxes of its first decade of existence, the practice of lofting moved naturally into the aeronautical realm

See this [website](http://www.melmoth2.com/texts/Lofting.htm) for more information.

This is how some lofted designs turn out.
