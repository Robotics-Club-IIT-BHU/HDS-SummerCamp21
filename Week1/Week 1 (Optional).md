# How to create an aerofoil in SolidWorks

## Scaling, Curve importing

Watch this [Recording by Raman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw2xplXarr0) where he creates an aerofoil in SW. Scaling is particularly useful when take the lazy path do make a part (i.e. copy some parts from[GrabCAD](grabcad.com/)). 

You will have to find the equation of a curve in numeric form from the internet (any eqn will do). You can also use this [page](http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/naca4digit) and play with the parameters.


## Remember that you will likely get the eqn in .csv format, you will have to change it into .txt
