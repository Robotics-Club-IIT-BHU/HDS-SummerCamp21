# Week 1 Challenge
## Watch these 4 videos, they will wind up parts. Next we will move on towards assemblies

[Tutorial 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XgXDEwvqJQQukhEA5nY1rGKtghLK_xS/view?usp=sharing) : Pay attention on how features interact and how some parts of a part need to be built upon offset planes. You will also see linear patterns (circular are pretty much the same)


[Tutorial 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drfmisQimBj458ODrOPE8r25s4SPefbb/view?usp=sharing) : Practice and review of all that you learnt so far.


[Tutorial 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/146Bx3wmSrZvrW4tRGV7YdTVdZnMgF9X6/view?usp=sharing)  : **IMP**, Revolve, sweep and revolve boss/base

[Tutorial 4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PGH6PjyLPrUxJpVmMp7vLgwpSSjuHEdD/view?usp=sharing): More intricare detailing on plastic parts. Ribs, Features to 'click' parts in place. This auto-key's outer cover is designed in SW along with the PCB so that during the manufacturing phase, no issues are encountered.


# Finally, this week's assignment.
## Create this connecting rod in SW. Remember to break it down into simpler elements as we did in the home page of this repo. Good luck!
